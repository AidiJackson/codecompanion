ADD REAL-TIME EVENT-SOURCED ORCHESTRATION WITH REDIS STREAMS:

Enhance the existing system with production-grade event streaming and real-time collaboration:

NEW REQUIREMENTS:
Add to requirements.txt:
- redis
- redis-streams
- asyncio-redis
- fastapi
- uvicorn

EVENT STREAMING ARCHITECTURE:
1. Event Bus (Redis Streams):
   - tasks: task creation, assignment, completion
   - artifacts: artifact creation, validation, approval
   - reviews: peer review requests, approvals, conflicts
   - metrics: performance data, routing decisions

2. Event Schema:
{
  "event_id": "evt_12345",
  "correlation_id": "task_142", 
  "event_type": "artifact_created",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-10T09:15:23Z",
  "agent_id": "claude_agent_1",
  "payload": {artifact_data},
  "metadata": {"confidence": 0.85, "cost_tokens": 1200}
}

3. Stream Consumers:
   - OrchestatorConsumer: coordinates workflow progression
   - RouterConsumer: updates model performance metrics
   - UIConsumer: broadcasts real-time updates to interface
   - MetricsConsumer: collects performance analytics

REAL-TIME FEATURES:
- Live artifact stream showing creation/updates in real-time
- Agent activity dashboard with current work assignments
- Event replay capability for debugging workflows
- Automatic workflow progression based on artifact completion
- Real-time conflict detection when agents disagree

FASTAPI BACKEND:
- WebSocket endpoints for real-time UI updates
- REST endpoints for artifact CRUD operations
- Event streaming endpoints for workflow monitoring
- Agent registration and health check endpoints

ENHANCED STREAMLIT UI:
- Real-time event feed with live updates
- Agent collaboration timeline showing handoffs
- Live workflow progress with automatic stage transitions
- Interactive artifact approval/rejection workflow
- Performance analytics dashboard with routing decisions

Integrate this with the existing artifact schemas and create a working demonstration of real-time multi-agent collaboration with event replay capability.
