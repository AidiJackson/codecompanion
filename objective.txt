Review the CodeCompanion repository.
Deliver:
- High-level architecture map (entrypoints: api.py, app.py, agents/*, services/*).
- Top 10 likely bugs with exact file paths and line ranges; include DatabaseManager None risks near ~186 and ~1964 in app.py if relevant.
- UI/UX quick wins with exact file paths (e.g., header/flag, hamburger, responsiveness).
- Security/auth risks (token handling in api.py, CORS, secrets leakage).
- Performance hotspots (blocking calls, race conditions; server_launcher.py, app.py).
- Testing plan: list files to add tests and 3 Playwright visual baselines.
- Prioritized 60-minute fixes (choose 1 bug file + 1 UI file) and provide unified diff patches if possible.
Constraints:
- Patch-only, <=25 lines per fix, no new dependencies.
- Reference exact file paths.
- Output as a compact report; include any diffs inside ```diff code fences.
