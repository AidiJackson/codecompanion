## Design Document: Sons of Anarchy Pinball

**1. Overview:**

This document outlines the UI/UX design for a pinball game themed around the television series Sons of Anarchy (SOA).  The game will aim to capture the gritty realism, intense action, and iconic imagery of the show while maintaining intuitive and engaging pinball gameplay.

**2. Target Audience:**

Fans of Sons of Anarchy, pinball enthusiasts, and casual gamers familiar with the genre.

**3. Goals:**

* Create an immersive and visually appealing pinball experience themed around SOA.
* Incorporate iconic characters, locations, and events from the show.
* Design intuitive controls and gameplay mechanics accessible to both novice and expert players.
* Develop a reward system that encourages replayability and skill mastery.

**4. UI Design:**

* **Playfield:** The playfield will feature iconic SOA imagery, including the clubhouse, Charming town, and key locations from the series.  Ramps, slingshots, and other obstacles will be themed around SOA elements (e.g., a ramp shaped like a motorcycle, a target representing Jax Teller’s tattoo).
* **Visuals:** High-quality artwork and animations will be used to showcase SOA characters, bikes, and scenes. The overall visual style will match the show’s gritty and dark aesthetic.
* **HUD (Heads-Up Display):** A clean and unobtrusive HUD will display the score, multipliers, special modes, and player progress.  The font and style will be consistent with the SOA branding.
* **Menus:**  Simple, intuitive menus for starting a game, selecting options (e.g., difficulty, sound), viewing high scores, and accessing bonus content (potentially unlockable art or behind-the-scenes content).


**5. UX Design:**

* **Gameplay Mechanics:** Standard pinball mechanics will be enhanced with SOA-specific features.  This could include:
    * **Special modes:** Triggered by hitting specific targets, completing tasks, or achieving high scores. These modes could involve mini-games based on key SOA storylines or challenges.
    * **Multiball:**  Initiated by hitting a designated target and featuring multiple balls in play simultaneously, increasing the scoring potential.
    * **Power-ups:**  Collected during gameplay, granting temporary advantages like increased score multipliers or special abilities.  These could be related to SOA characters or weapons.
* **Progression & Rewards:** The game will incorporate a progression system that rewards players for skillful play and allows them to unlock new content.  This could include:
    * **Unlockable characters:**  Portraits or animations of key SOA characters appear during gameplay or unlockable in the gallery.
    * **High score tracking:**  Leaderboards for local and online play to promote competition.
    * **Achievements:**  Unlockable achievements for completing specific tasks or reaching milestones.

**6.  Monetization (if applicable):**

* **Premium Version:**  A one-time purchase unlocks the full game and all content.
* **In-app Purchases (Optional):**  Potential for cosmetic items (e.g., alternative playfield designs, ball skins)


**7.  Future Considerations:**

* **Online Multiplayer:**  Enable players to compete against each other online.
* **Expansion Packs:**  Add new playfield elements, characters, and game modes based on different SOA seasons or storylines.


**8.  Technology:**

*  [Specify game engine, platforms (e.g., Unity, Unreal Engine; PC, mobile, arcade cabinet)]
