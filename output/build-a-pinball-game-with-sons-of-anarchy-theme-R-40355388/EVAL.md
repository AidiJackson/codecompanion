Here's an EvalReport for the CodePatch and TestPlan for building a Sons of Anarchy themed pinball game:

EvalReport:

Risks:
1. Licensing and copyright issues: Using the Sons of Anarchy theme without proper authorization could lead to legal problems.
2. Content sensitivity: The mature themes of Sons of Anarchy may not be suitable for all audiences, potentially limiting the game's market.
3. Complexity of pinball physics: Accurately simulating pinball mechanics can be challenging and may require significant development time.
4. Balancing gameplay: Ensuring the game is challenging but not frustratingly difficult could be tricky.
5. Performance issues: Rendering complex 3D graphics and physics calculations simultaneously may strain some systems.

Next Steps:
1. Obtain necessary licenses and permissions from the Sons of Anarchy rights holders.
2. Develop a detailed game design document outlining specific Sons of Anarchy elements to incorporate.
3. Create a prototype focusing on core pinball mechanics before adding themed elements.
4. Implement a basic physics engine and test thoroughly for realistic ball behavior.
5. Design and model 3D assets for the pinball table, including Sons of Anarchy specific elements.
6. Develop a scoring system and special game modes tied to the show's themes.
7. Implement sound effects and music, potentially using clips from the show if licensed.
8. Conduct extensive playtesting to balance difficulty and enjoyment.
9. Optimize performance across different hardware configurations.
10. Plan for potential age restrictions or content warnings due to mature themes.

Note: This EvalReport is based on general knowledge of game development and the Sons of Anarchy franchise. Without seeing the specific CodePatch and TestPlan, the assessment may not cover all aspects of the proposed implementation.
