Here's an EvalReport for the CodePatch and TestPlan for building a Sons of Anarchy themed pinball game:

EvalReport:

Risks:
1. Licensing and copyright issues: Using the Sons of Anarchy theme without proper authorization could lead to legal problems.
2. Age restrictions: The mature content of Sons of Anarchy may require age verification for players.
3. Complexity: Pinball games have many moving parts and intricate physics, which can be challenging to implement accurately.
4. Performance issues: Ensuring smooth gameplay and realistic ball physics may strain system resources.
5. Balance: Creating a game that is challenging but not frustratingly difficult may require extensive playtesting and adjustment.

Next Steps:
1. Obtain necessary licenses and permissions from the Sons of Anarchy rights holders.
2. Define the scope of the game, including specific Sons of Anarchy elements to incorporate (characters, locations, storylines).
3. Create a detailed design document outlining game mechanics, scoring system, and special features.
4. Develop a prototype focusing on core pinball physics and basic gameplay.
5. Implement Sons of Anarchy theming, including artwork, sound effects, and music.
6. Conduct thorough playtesting to balance difficulty and enjoyment.
7. Implement age verification system if required due to mature content.
8. Optimize performance for target platforms.
9. Develop a marketing strategy that appeals to both pinball enthusiasts and Sons of Anarchy fans.
10. Plan for post-launch support, including bug fixes and potential additional content.

Note: As no specific CodePatch or TestPlan was provided, this EvalReport is based on general considerations for developing a Sons of Anarchy themed pinball game. A more detailed analysis would require reviewing the actual code and test plans.
