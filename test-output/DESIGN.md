## Design Document: Hello World App

**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the UI/UX design for a simple "Hello, World!" application. The app's primary function is to display the text "Hello, World!" to the user.  The design prioritizes simplicity and ease of understanding.

**2. Goals**

* Display the "Hello, World!" message clearly and prominently.
* Provide a clean and minimalist user interface.
* Be accessible and usable across a variety of devices.

**3. User Stories**

* As a user, I want to open the app and immediately see the "Hello, World!" message.
* As a user, I want the app to be easy to understand and navigate.

**4. UI Design**

* **Screen 1 (Main Screen):**
    * The entire screen will display the text "Hello, World!" in a large, easily readable font (e.g., sans-serif, size 24sp or larger).
    * The text will be centered both horizontally and vertically.
    * The background will be a solid, neutral color (e.g., white or light gray).

* **No other screens or interactions are required.**


**5. UX Design**

* The user experience will be extremely straightforward.  Upon launching the app, the user will immediately see the message. No user input or navigation is necessary.

**6. Technical Considerations**

* The app should be designed for both portrait and landscape orientation.
* The text should be appropriately sized and styled for different screen sizes and resolutions.
* The app should be lightweight and consume minimal resources.


**7. Future Considerations (Optional)**

* While not part of the MVP, future iterations could include:
    * Customizable greetings (allowing users to input their own message).
    * Different background colors or themes.
    * A simple animation or transition effect.


**8. Conclusion**

This simple "Hello, World!" app prioritizes clarity and ease of use.  The design aims to provide a functional and user-friendly experience with minimal complexity.
