Here's an EvalReport for the "Build a simple hello world app" task:

EvalReport:

1. CodePatch Review:
   No specific CodePatch was provided for review. A basic "Hello World" app typically consists of a simple print statement or equivalent in the chosen programming language.

2. TestPlan Review:
   No specific TestPlan was provided for review. A basic test plan for a "Hello World" app would typically involve running the program and verifying the correct output.

3. Risks:
   a. Lack of specificity: Without more details about the programming language or environment, there's a risk of misalignment between expectations and implementation.
   b. Oversimplification: While a "Hello World" app is meant to be simple, there's a risk of it being too basic to provide meaningful learning or demonstration value.
   c. Missing requirements: Without clear requirements, there's a risk of overlooking important aspects such as proper error handling or cross-platform compatibility.

4. Next Steps:
   a. Clarify requirements: Specify the programming language, target platform, and any additional features required beyond a basic "Hello World" output.
   b. Develop the app: Create the simple "Hello World" program using the specified language and requirements.
   c. Implement basic error handling: Even for a simple app, consider adding basic error handling to improve robustness.
   d. Create a more comprehensive test plan: Include tests for different scenarios, such as running the app multiple times or in different environments.
   e. Document the code: Add comments and a basic README file to explain how to run the app and what it does.
   f. Consider expansion: Plan for potential future enhancements to make the app more interesting or educational, such as accepting user input or demonstrating basic programming concepts.

This EvalReport highlights the need for more specific requirements and suggests steps to create a more robust and valuable "Hello World" app, even in its simplicity.
